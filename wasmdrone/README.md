# WASMDrone

![WASMDrone](../images/wasmdrone-pybadge-tello.jpg)

This application lets you write a WebAssembly program that runs on a hardware device with connected wireless to fly a DJI Tello drone.

You need a PyBadge with an AirLift WiFi or similar device to run this example.

## How it works

The application has 2 devices: the Display device for showing status, and the Drone device for communicating to the connected DJI Tello drone.

## How to run

### PyBadge

```
$ mecha flash -i wasman -m -params main.ssid=TELLO-XXXXXX pybadge
